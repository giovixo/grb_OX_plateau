# grb_OX_plateau

A repository for the study of the GRB afterglow plateau feature in X ray and optical bands (Stratta et al. 2022, Mem SAIT, in prep. )

## data
This directory contains the  results (in form of plots) of the spectro-temporal analysis performed on the afterglows of 34 GRBs with known redshifts, well monitored optical afterglows and clear evidence of an X-ray plateau.




##### Light curves plot's caption:  
*Top panel*: blue stars and green dots represent the afterglow X-ray and R-band flux density, respectively. Vertical dotted lines encompass the data set we took into account in the broken power law fit. Vertical blue and green stripes mark the best fit temporal break in the X-ray and optical band, respectively. Cyan down and up triangles mark the maximum and minimum flux values extrapolated from X-rays assuming a simple power law with spectral index &beta;opt,X=&beta;X and &beta;opt,X=&beta;X-0.5, respectively. Magenta points represent the rebinned data where the X-ray spectral index was measured. Optical data during the X-ray plateau phase are on average consistent with the allowed range of values for synchrotron emission, with the cooling frequency &nu;c slowly crossing the observational frequency band. *Bottom panel*: The X-ray spectral index evolution with time.

##### Plateau duration comparison plot's caption:
This plot shows a comparison of the best fit broken power law temporal breaks obtained from optical and X-ray data. The temporal breaks are an estimate of the plateau durations and are computed in the GRB rest frame. On the vertical(horizontal) axis an histogram shows the distribution of the temporal breaks obtained from optical(X-ray) data.  


### Data sources
* X-ray fluxes are taken from the [Swift/XRT Repository] (https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves/)
* Optical data are taken from Kann et al. 2010, ApJ 720, 1513, Kann et al. 2011 ApJ 734, 96 and Kann et al. 2022 (in prep.)
