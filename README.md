# grb_OX_plateau

A repository for the study of the GRB afterglow plateau feature in X ray and optical bands (Stratta et al. 2022, Mem SAIT, in prep. )

## ./data
This directory contains the plots of the spectro-temporal analysis performed on the afterglows of the GRBs belonging to the "golden" and "silver" subsamples.

### Light curve plot's caption:  
*Top panel*: blue stars and green dots represent the afterglow X-ray and R-band flux density, respectively. Vertical dotted lines encompass the data set we took into account in the broken power law fit. Vertical blue and green stripes mark the best fit temporal break in the X-ray and optical band, respectively. Cyan down and up triangles mark the maximum and minimum flux values extrapolated from X-rays assuming a simple power law with spectral index &beta;opt,X=&beta;X and &beta;opt,X=&beta;X-0.5, respectively. Magenta points represent the rebinned data where the X-ray spectral index was measured. Optical data during the X-ray platea phase are clearly consistent with the allowed range of values for synchrotron emission, with &nu;c slowly crossing the optical band. *Bottom panel*: The X-ray spectral index evolution with time.

### Data bibliography
* X-ray fluxes are taken from the [Swift/XRT Repository] (https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves/)
* Optical data are taken from Kann et al. 2010, ApJ 720, 1513, Kann et al. 2011 ApJ 734, 96 and Kann et al. 2022 (in prep.)
