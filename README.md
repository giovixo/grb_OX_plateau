# grb_OX_plateau

A repository for the study of the GRB afterglow plateau feature in X ray and optical bands (Stratta et al. 2022, Mem SAIT, in prep. )

## data
This directory contains the results obtained from the spectro-temporal analysis performed on the afterglows of 29 GRBs with known redshifts, well monitored optical afterglows and clear evidence of an X-ray plateau.




##### Light curves plot's caption:  
*Top panel*: blue stars and green dots represent the afterglow X-ray and R-band flux density, respectively. Blue vertical dotted lines mark the X-ray plateau phase. Cyan down and up triangles mark the maximum and minimum flux density values extrapolated from X-rays assuming a simple power law with spectral index &beta;opt,x = &beta;x and &beta;opt,x = &beta;x-0.5, respectively. Magenta points represent the rebinned data where the X-ray spectral index was measured. Black dashed line is the best fit broken power law model. Note that the data used for the fit are only those  encompassed by the black dashed line, i.e. where the plateau and post-plateau phases are dominant.

*Bottom panel*: The X-ray spectral index &beta;x versus time. These indexes have been used to compute the maximum and minimum R-band flux densities (up and down cyan triangles in the top panel) by assuming a simple power law spectrum with index &beta;opt,x = &beta;x and &beta;opt,x = &beta;x-0.5



##### Best fit parameter tables:
The three .txt files contains the broken power law model best fit parameters obtained for the X-ray light curves belonging to both the "silver" and "golden" subsamples, and for the optical ones belonging to the "golden sample" only (i.e. with smoothed light curves well approximated by a simple or a broken power law).



### Data sources
* X-ray fluxes are taken from the [Swift/XRT Repository] (https://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves/)
* Optical data are taken from Kann et al. 2010, ApJ 720, 1513, Kann et al. 2011 ApJ 734, 96 and Kann et al. 2022 (in prep.)
